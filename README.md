Hello Stranger, 

Weather App is a web application that gives the weather informations for a given city. 
This web application uses a MongoDB database to store information about a given city and the stored information can be retrieved even after the user closes the navogator and relaunches the application. 
The weather information is collected from a webservice called Open Weather Map. 

Happy Coding !
